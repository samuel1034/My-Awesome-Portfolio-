I built this Disney+ clone as a fully-responsive web application with a focus on user experience and design accuracy. Leveraging React and Vite, I implemented interactive features like smooth animations, real-time search, and navigation inspired by Disneyâ€™s original UI, giving users an authentic streaming experience. Tailwind CSS facilitated rapid styling while maintaining scalability across device types. This project also involved optimizing for performance and load speed, ensuring smooth transitions and responsiveness under high-load scenarios.

This Disney Clone project underscores my ability to:
- Implement complex UI structures and intuitive interactions with React components.
- Utilize Vite for efficient builds and fast load times.
- Create responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly across screens.
- Use Tailwind CSS to deliver consistent, scalable design across the entire app.

This clone reflects my commitment to code quality, design detail, and performance, essential skills for delivering impactful digital experiences in the fast-paced world of frontend development.
